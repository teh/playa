what is it
==========

It's a trivial music player. Run it on a path, e.g.

::

    python playa.py /home/tom/Music

load up localhost:8000 in a modern-ish browser and voila.

I developed this because my ipad can't download music and I don't own
a machine capable of running itunes (let me know when the linux
version comes out ha ha).
